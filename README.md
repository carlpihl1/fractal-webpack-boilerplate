# Fractal Webpack Boilerplate

Opinionated boilerplate for [Fractal](https://fractal.build/) with [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and plugins for building assets.

All assets are in the "assets" folder. Images will be copied and minified. Js will be built with webpack and minified, as will scss. Icons will be copied to a svg sprite.

Run "npm run dev" to start a fractal dev server as well as webpack watching for file changes.

Run "npm run build" to build production files.
